**Summary:**
Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML, and CSS.
In the code, we convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions, read data from the js file, and use forEach syntax to list out the table element. Finally, we also set up the tag styles in the CSS file.
